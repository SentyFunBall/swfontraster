# SWFontRaster
### (AKA SenFont until I find a better name)

Very simple little project where I try to make a font rasterizer in Stormworks. Since modded monitors were possible, I got fed up with the big blocky text. There are existing renderers to let me scale up the text, but it's still blocky. Using a custom rasterizer aims to fix that issue by using BÃ©zier curves to render the text. This also allows the text to be scaled, rotated, flipped, colored in almost any way quickly and dynamically, for richer text than Stormworks could ever provide. This is the future of text in Stormworks (At a large scale)
